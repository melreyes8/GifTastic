On the page, users can click on the displayed buttons of Disney films and 10 gifs along with their ratings from GIPHY API that correspond to the Disney film name will appear for each button pressed. The 10 gifs will be replaced by another set of 10 gifs when another button is pressed.

Users can also add a new button by submitting a Disney film name. The new button, when pressed, will also display 10 gifs. 

The initial load of the 10 gifs is set to non-animated. When GIPHY images are clicked, they animate, and when clicked again, they return to non-animated.
